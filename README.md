This repository contains the projects that I worked on for data analysis and statistical modeling. The projects are written in R (R Markdown) or Python (Jupyter Notebook).

# Research Project
## Predicting Breast Cancer Related Cardiotoxicity On Electronic Health Records (EHR) Data
Codes  
Cardiotoxicity is the condition when the heart muscle is damaged, making the heart unable to pump blood through the body. This might be caused by chemotherapy treatments, so there is a need to detect and predict cardiotoxicity at early stages for breast cancer patients. Several predictive models were implemented, using phenotypic data extracted from electronic health records and clinical notes.

[Blog post](https://medium.com/@nguy3409/discovering-overarching-themes-of-kpop-boy-band-bts-using-machine-learning-246c69115ac8)  
[Codes](https://github.com/ptnguyen128/lyrics-analysis)  
This project utitlized various natural language processing (NLP) techniques to mine lyrics of all the songs from Kpop group BTS in order to analyze the overall themes of their music.  
**Keywords:** Python, NLP, Topic Modeling, Text Mining

## Vietnamese Music Genre Classification
[Codes](https://github.com/ptnguyen128/DS-portfolio/tree/master/Python/music-genre-classification)  
Music genre classification has always been a difficult problem, especially for non-English songs. This project aimed to build a music classifier to detect the correct genre of a given Vietnamese song.  
Note: Training and testing data were provided by Zalo Vietnam, but were not allowed to be taken out.

## Minnesconsin Insurance Company Modeling Problem by Travelers Analytics  
[R Codes](https://github.com/ptnguyen128/DS-portfolio/blob/master/R/8051.pdf)  [Report](https://github.com/ptnguyen128/DS-portfolio/blob/master/8051Report.pdf)  
This project was hosted by Travelers Analytics as a final project for the course STAT8051 at the University of Minnesota. 
This case study aimed to predict a list of people who potentially would cancel their policies at Minnesconsin Insurance Company in the next year, based on 4 years of property insurance policy records.  
Note: Training and testing data were provided by Travelers Analytics, but were not allowed to be taken out.   
**Keywords:** R, Logistic Regression

## TalkingData AdTracking Fraud Detection
[Python Notebook](https://github.com/ptnguyen128/DS-portfolio/blob/master/Python/TalkingData.ipynb)  
This Kaggle competition aimed to build an algorithm that predicts whether a user will download an application after clicking a mobile advertisement. Gradient boosting decision tree algorithm (LightGBM) was chosen as the final model.  
**Keywords:** Python, Data Visualization, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, LightGBM
